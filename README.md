this is an experimental way of learning quantitiative modelling in finance with "R" ,
so i have made a list of 50 sample projects covering from basics to the required advanced levels in the quantitative analysis.
each sample will be working on different topics regarding quantitaitve analysis , econometric models with touch of financial analysis of stocks 
here are the lits of 50 samples we will be working on :
